Variables have an adress in memory, for example:

int Var {22}

has an adress at 1008 so int* p_var would equal to 1008



Stack VS Heap



Stack: 

Memory is finite 

The developer isnt in full control of the memory lifetime i.e. not controlled when the variable 
is wiped off the memory

lifetime is controlled by the scope mechanism 



Heap:

Memory is fininte 

developer is in full control of when memory is allocated and when it is released 

lifetime is controled explicitly through new and delete opertators
